	abstract = {Secondary manifestations of spinal cord injury beyond motor and sensory dysfunction can negatively affect a person's quality of life. Spinal cord injury is associated with an increased incidence of depression and anxiety; however, the mechanisms of this relationship are currently not well understood. Human and animal studies suggest that changes in the composition of the intestinal microbiota (dysbiosis) are associated with mood disorders. The objective of the current study is to establish a model of anxiety following a cervical contusion spinal cord injury in rats and to determine whether the microbiota play a role in the observed behavioural changes. We found that spinal cord injury caused dysbiosis and increased symptoms of anxiety-like behaviour. Treatment with a fecal transplant prevented both spinal cord injury-induced dysbiosis as well as the development of anxiety-like behaviour. These results indicate that an incomplete unilateral cervical spinal cord injury can cause affective disorders and intestinal dysbiosis, and that both can be prevented by treatment with fecal transplant therapy.},

	abstract = {Low neuronal {cAMP} levels in adults and a further decline following traumatic central nervous system ({CNS}) injury has been associated with the limited ability of neurons to regenerate. An approach to increase neuronal {cAMP} levels post injury is electrical stimulation. Stimulation as a tool to promote neuronal growth has largely been studied in the peripheral nervous system or in spared fibers of the {CNS} and this research suggests that a single session of electrical stimulation is sufficient to initiate a long-lasting axonal growth program. Here, we sought to promote plasticity and growth of the injured corticospinal tract with electrical cortical stimulation immediately after its spinal injury. Moreover, given the importance of rehabilitative motor training in the clinical setting and in translating plasticity into functional recovery, we applied training as a standard treatment to all rats (i.e., with or without electrical stimulation). Our findings show that electrical cortical stimulation did improve recovery in forelimb function compared to the recovery in unstimulated animals. This recovery is likely linked to increased corticospinal tract plasticity as evidenced by a significant increase in sprouting of collaterals above the lesion site, but not to increased regenerative growth through the lesion itself.},

	abstract = {Rehabilitative training is one of the most successful therapies to promote motor recovery after spinal cord injury, especially when applied early after injury. Polytrauma and management of other medical complications in the acute post-injury setting often preclude or complicate early rehabilitation. Therefore, interventions that reopen a window of opportunity for effective motor training after chronic injury would have significant therapeutic value. Here, we tested whether this could be achieved in rats with chronic (8 weeks) dorsolateral quadrant sections of the cervical spinal cord (C4) by inducing mild neuroinflammation. We found that systemic injection of a low dose of lipopolysaccharide improved the efficacy of rehabilitative training on forelimb function, as assessed using a single pellet reaching and grasping task. This enhanced recovery was found to be dependent on the training intensity, where a high-intensity paradigm induced the biggest improvements. Importantly, in contrast to training alone, the combination of systemic lipopolysaccharide and high-intensity training restored original function (reparative plasticity) rather than enhancing new motor strategies (compensatory plasticity). Accordingly, electrophysiological and tract-tracing studies demonstrated a recovery in the cortical drive to the affected forelimb muscles and a restructuration of the corticospinal innervation of the cervical spinal cord. Thus, we propose that techniques that can elicit mild neuroinflammation may be used to enhance the efficacy of rehabilitative training after chronic spinal cord injury.},

The {RtST} drives the initiation of locomotion and postural control. {RtST} axons form new contacts with propriospinal interneurons ({PrINs}) after incomplete spinal cord injury ({SCI}); however, it is unclear if injured or uninjured axons make these connections. We completely transected all traced {RtST} axons in rats using a staggered model, where a hemisection {SCI} at vertebra T10 is followed by a contralateral hemisection at vertebra T7. In one group of the animals, the T7 {SCI} was performed 2 weeks after the T10 {SCI} (delayed; {dSTAG}), and in another group, the T10 and T7 {SCIs} were concomitant ({cSTAG}). {dSTAG} animals had significantly more {RtST}-{PrIN} contacts in the grey matter compared to {cSTAG} animals (p {\textless} 0.05). These results were accompanied by enhanced locomotor recovery with {dSTAG} animals significantly outperforming {cSTAG} animals ({BBB} test; p {\textless} 0.05). This difference suggests that activity in neuronal networks below the first {SCI} may contribute to enhanced recovery, because {dSTAG} rats recovered locomotor ability before the second hemisection. In conclusion, our findings support the hypothesis that the injured {RtST} forms new connections and is a key player in the recovery of locomotion post-{SCI}.},

	abstract = {Spinal cord injury results in a wide range of behavioral changes including impaired motor and sensory function, autonomic dysfunction, spasticity, and depression. Currently, restoring lost motor function is the most actively studied and sought-after goal of spinal cord injury research. This research is rooted in the fact that although self-repair following spinal cord injury in adult mammals is very limited, there can be some recovery of motor function. This recovery is strongly dependent on the lesion size and location as well as on neural activity of denervated networks activated mainly through physical activity (i.e., rehabilitative training). Recovery of motor function is largely due to neuroplasticity, which includes adaptive changes in spared and injured neural circuitry. Neuroplasticity after spinal cord injury is extensive and includes mechanisms such as moderate axonal sprouting, the formation of new synaptic connections, network remapping, and changes to neuron cell properties. Neuroplasticity after spinal cord injury has been described at various physiological and anatomical levels of the central nervous system including the brain, brainstem, and spinal cord, both above and below injury sites. The growing number of mechanisms underlying postinjury plasticity indicate the vast complexity of injury-induced plasticity. This poses important opportunities to further enhance and harness plasticity in order to promote recovery. However, the diversity of neuroplasticity also creates challenges for research, which is frequently based on mechanistically driven approaches. The appreciation of the complexity of neuronal plasticity and the findings that recovery is based on a multitude and interlinked adaptations will be essential in developing meaningful new treatment avenues.},

Regardless of source, loss of grafted {SCs} post-grafting is an issue in studies of regeneration, with survival rates ranging from ∼1 to 20\% after ≥6 weeks in rodent models of {SCI}. Immune rejection has been implicated in these low survival rates. Therefore, our aim was to explore the role of the immune response on grafted {SKP}-{SC} survival in Fischer rats with a spinal hemisection injury. We compared {SKP}-{SC} survival 6 weeks post-transplantation in: (I) cyclosporine-immunosuppressed rats (n=8), ({II}) immunocompetent rats (n=9), and ({III}) rats of a different sub-strain than the {SKP}-{SC} donor rats (n=7). {SKP}-{SC} survival was similar in all groups, suggesting immune rejection was not a main factor in {SKP}-{SC} loss observed in this study. {SKP}-{SCs} were consistently found on laminin expressed at the injury site, indicating detachment-mediated apoptosis (i.e., anoikis) might play a major role in grafted cell loss.},

The transplant of neural stem cells ({NSCs}) is a promising approach for the repair of {SCI}. Reprogramming of adult somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells ({iPSCs}) is expected to provide an autologous source of {iPSC}-derived {NSCs}, avoiding the immune response as well as ethical issues. However, there is still limited information on the behavior and differentiation pattern of transplanted {iPSC}-derived {NSCs} within the damaged spinal cord. We transplanted {iPSC}-derived {NSCs}, obtained from adult human somatic cells, into rats at 0 or 7 days after {SCI}, and evaluated motor-evoked potentials and locomotion of the animals. We histologically analyzed engraftment, proliferation, and differentiation of the {iPSC}-derived {NSCs} and the spared tissue in the spinal cords at 7, 21, and 63 days posttransplant. Both transplanted groups showed a late decline in functional recovery compared to vehicle-injected groups. Histological analysis showed proliferation of transplanted cells within the tissue and that cells formed a mass. At the final time point, most grafted cells differentiated to neural and astroglial lineages, but not into oligodendrocytes, while some grafted cells remained undifferentiated and proliferative. The proinflammatory tissue microenviroment of the injured spinal cord induced proliferation of the grafted cells and, therefore, there are possible risks associated with {iPSC}-derived {NSC} transplantation. New approaches are needed to promote and guide cell differentiation, as well as reduce their tumorigenicity once the cells are transplanted at the lesion site.},

In the present study, we subjected mice transgenic for human {IL}-37 ({hIL}-37tg) and wild-type ({WT}) mice to spinal cord contusion injury and then treated them with recombinant human {IL}-37 ({rIL}-37). In the {hIL}-37tg mice, the expression of {IL}-37 was barely detectable in the uninjured cords, but was strongly induced at 24 h and 72 h after the spinal cord injury ({SCI}). Compared with {WT} mice, {hIL}-37tg mice exhibited increased myelin and neuronal sparing and protection against locomotor deficits, including 2.5-fold greater speed in a forced treadmill challenge. Reduced levels of cytokines (e.g., an 80\% reduction in {IL}-6) were observed in the injured cords of {hIL}-37tg mice, along with lower numbers of blood-borne neutrophils, macrophages, and activated microglia. We treated {WT} mice with a single intraspinal injection of either full-length or processed {rIL}-37 after the injury and found that the {IL}-37-treated mice had significantly enhanced locomotor skills in an open field using the Basso Mouse Scale, as well as supported faster speed on a mechanical treadmill. Treatment with both forms of {rIL}-37 led to similar beneficial effects on locomotor recovery after {SCI}. This study presents novel data indicating that {IL}-37 suppresses inflammation in a clinically relevant model of {SCI}, and suggests that {rIL}-37 may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of acute {SCI}.},

The single pellet grasping ({SPG}) task is a skilled forelimb motor task used to evaluate recovery of forelimb function in rodent models of {SCI}. The task requires animals to obtain food pellets located on a shelf beyond a slit at the front of an enclosure. Manually training and testing rats in the {SPG} task requires extensive time and often yields results with high outcome variability and small therapeutic windows (i.e., the difference between pre- and post-{SCI} success rates). Recent advances in automated {SPG} training using automated pellet presentation ({APP}) systems allow rats to train ad libitum 24h a day, 7 days a week. {APP} trained rats have improved success rates, require less researcher time, and have lower outcome variability compared to manually trained rats. However, it is unclear whether {APP} trained rats can perform the {SPG} task using the {APP} system after {SCI}. Here we show that rats with cervical {SCI} can successfully perform the {SPG} task using the {APP} system. We found that {SCI} rats with {APP} training performed significantly more attempts, had slightly lower and less variable final score success rates, and larger therapeutic windows than {SCI} rats with manual training. These results demonstrate that {APP} training has clear advantages over manual training for evaluating reaching performance of {SCI} rats and represents a new tool for investigating rehabilitative motor training following {CNS} injury.},

In parallel, we have generated a stable {OEC} cell line overexpressing the Nogo receptor ({NgR}) ectodomain to reduce {MAI}-associated inhibition in vitro and in vivo.

Even when regeneration is successful, unspecific reinnervation and the limited reconnection of the spinal circuits impair functional recovery. The aim of this study was to describe the changes that axotomized motoneurons suffer after peripheral nerve injury and how activity-dependent therapies and neurotrophic factors can modulate these events. We observed a marked decrease in glutamatergic synapses, with a maximum peak at two weeks post-axotomy, which was only partially reversed with time. This decrease was accompanied by an increase in gephyrin immunoreactivity and a disintegration of perineuronal nets ({PNNs}) surrounding the motoneurons. Direct application of neurotrophins at the proximal stump was not able to reverse these effects. In contrast, activity-dependent treatment, in the form of treadmill running, reduced the observed destructuring of perineuronal nets and the loss of glutamatergic synapses two weeks after injury. These changes were proportional to the intensity of the exercise protocol. Blockade of sensory inputs from the homolateral hindlimb also reduced {PNN} immunoreactivity around intact motoneurons, and in that case treadmill running did not reverse that loss, suggesting that the effects of exercise on motoneuron {PNN} depend on increased sensory activity. Preservation of motoneuron {PNN} and reduction of synaptic stripping by exercise could facilitate the maintenance of the spinal circuitry and benefit functional recovery after peripheral nerve injury.},

Mesenchymal stem cells ({MSC}) have demonstrated beneficial effects following transplantation in animal models of {SCI}. However, despite the immunoprivilege properties of the {MSC}, their survival in the injured spinal cord is reduced due to the detrimental milieu in the damaged tissue and immune rejection of the cells. The limited survival of the engrafted cells may determine the therapy success. Therefore, we compared two strategies to increase the presence of the cells in the injured spinal cord in rats: increasing the amount of {MSC} transplants and using immunosuppressive treatment with {FK}506 after transplantation. Functional outcomes for locomotion and electrophysiological responses were assessed. The grafted cells survival and the amount of cavity and spared tissue were studied. The findings indicate that immunosuppression improved grafted cells survival. A cell-dose effect was found regarding locomotion recovery and tissue protection independent of immunosuppression. Nevertheless, immunosuppression enhanced the electrophysiological outcomes and allowed filling of the cavity formed after injury by new regenerative tissue and axons. These results indicate that {MSC} transplantation combined with immunosuppression prolongs the survival of engrafted cells and improves functional and morphological outcomes after {SCI}.},

Both bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells ({MSCs}; also known as bone marrow-derived 'mesenchymal stem cells') and olfactory ensheathing cells ({OECs}) have demonstrated beneficial effects following transplantation in animal models of {SCI}. However, due to the large number of affecting parameters that determine the therapy success and the lack of methodological consensus, the comparison of different works is difficult. Therefore, we compared the effects of {MSC} and {OEC} transplants at early or delayed time after a spinal cord contusion injury in the rat. Functional outcomes for locomotion, sensory perception and electrophysiological responses were assessed. Moreover, the grafted cells survival and the amount of cavity and spared tissue were studied. The findings indicate that grafted cells survived until 7 days post-injection, but markedly disappeared in the following 2 weeks. Despite the low survival of the cells, {MSC} and {OEC} grafts provided tissue protection after early and delayed transplantation. Nevertheless, only acute {MSC} grafts improved locomotion recovery in treadmill condition and electrophysiological outcomes with respect to the other injured groups. These results, together with previous works, indicate that the {MSC} seem a better option than {OEC} for treatment of contusion injuries.},

However, the changes induced by these cells after their transplantation into the injured spinal cord remain largely unknown. We analyzed the changes in the spinal cord transcriptome after a contusion injury and {MSC} or {OEC} transplantation. The cells were injected immediately or 7 days after the injury. The {mRNA} of the spinal cord injured segment was extracted and analyzed by microarray at 2 and 7 days after cell grafting. The gene profiles were analyzed by clustering and functional enrichment analysis based on the Gene Ontology database. We found that both {MSC} and {OEC} transplanted acutely after injury induce an early up-regulation of genes related to tissue protection and regeneration. In contrast, cells transplanted at 7 days after injury down-regulate genes related to tissue regeneration. The most important change after {MSC} or {OEC} transplant was a marked increase in expression of genes associated with foreign body response and adaptive immune response. These data suggest a regulatory effect of {MSC} and {OEC} transplantation after {SCI} regarding tissue repair processes, but a fast rejection response to the grafted cells. Our results provide an initial step to determine the mechanisms of action and to optimize cell therapy for {SCI}.},

	doi = {10.1111/nan.12083},
	abstract = {{AIMS}: Dithiocarb (diethyldithiocarbamate, {DEDTC}) belongs to the group of dithiocarbamates and is the main metabolite of disulphiram, a drug of choice for the treatment of alcohol dependence. Its therapeutic potential relays on its ability to create an unpleasant aversive reaction following the ingestion of alcohol, and this effect is usually accompanied by neurobehavioural symptoms. Most of these can be attributed to the impaired metabolism of brain biogenic amines.
{METHODS}: To gain new insights into the dithiocarbamates and their effects on neurotransmitter systems, an in vivo experimental model based on daily injections of {DEDTC} in adult mice for 7 days was established. To this end, the concentrations of the three major brain monoamines, dopamine ({DA}), noradrenaline ({NA}) and serotonin (5-{HT}) were measured in whole brain extracts with high-performance liquid chromatography ({HPLC}). The levels of D2 dopamine receptor (D2R) were evaluated by Western blot and by immunohistochemical techniques the cell pattern of tyrosine hydroxylase ({TH}), dopa beta hydroxylase ({DBH}) and choline acetyltransferase {ChAT}) were analysed.
{RESULTS}: A significant reduction in {DA} and 5-{HT} levels was observed, whereas {NA} was not affected. Moreover, decreases in D2R levels, as well as in enzymes such as {TH}, {DBH} and {ChAT}, were found.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Our data suggest that {DEDTC} provokes alterations in biogenic amines and in different substrates of neurotransmitter systems, which could explain some of the neurobehavioural effects observed in patients treated with disulphiram.},

	abstract = {Ventral spinal root avulsion causes complete denervation of muscles in the limb and also progressive death of segmental motoneurons ({MN}) leading to permanent paralysis. The chances for functional recovery after ventral root avulsion are very poor owing to the loss of avulsed neurons and the long distance that surviving neurons have to re-grow axons from the spinal cord to the corresponding targets. Following unilateral avulsion of L4, L5 and L6 spinal roots in adult rats, we performed an intraspinal transplant of mesenchymal stem cells ({MSC}) and surgical re-implantation of the avulsed roots. Four weeks after avulsion the survival of {MN} in the {MSC}-treated animals was significantly higher than in vehicle-injected rats (45\% vs. 28\%). Re-implantation of the avulsed roots in the injured spinal cord allowed the regeneration of motor axons. By combining root re-implantation and {MSC} transplant the number of surviving {MN} at 28 days post-injury was higher (60\%) than in re-implantation alone animals (46\%). Electromyographic tests showed evidence of functional re-innervation of anterior tibialis and gastrocnemius muscles by the regenerated motor axons only in rats with the combined treatment. These results indicate that {MSC} are helpful in enhancing neuronal survival and increased the regenerative growth of injured axons. Surgical re-implantation and {MSC} grafting combined had a synergic neuroprotective effect on {MN} and on axonal regeneration and muscle re-innervation after spinal root avulsion.},

For this reason, we have used several functional methods to assess gross and fine locomotion deficits, as well as electrophysiological data to study the dysfunctions underlying the behavioral changes. Moreover, an extensive study based on the quantification of alternation and coordination parameters during gait has been done. Spinal cord injuries of varying severity (mild contusion, moderate contusion and hemisection) were performed at the thoracic level in adult rats that were followed-up for 6 weeks. Lesions resulting in similar scores in the open field test (i.e. mild contusion and hemisection) caused more marked differences in fine coordination when assessed by quantitative coordination analysis based on a digitized walking treadmill. In conclusion, gross and fine deficits can be detected using a battery of tests based on the performance of the animals during tasks of different difficulty. When used appropriately, they become useful tools to study functional recovery due to spontaneous plastic changes or to therapeutic interventions after {SCI}, as well as to test the effects of new therapies.},

After the initial insult to the spinal cord, additional structure and function are lost through an active and complex secondary process. Since there is not effective treatment for {SCI}, several strategies including cellular, pharmacological and rehabilitation therapies have been approached in animal models. Some of them have been proved in clinical trials. In this review we focus on the current state of cell therapies, particularly on cells from adult origin, assayed in preclinical research. Cell types used in {SCI} therapy include Schwann cells, olfactory ensheathing cells and adult stem cells, such as neural stem cells, umbilical cord blood derived cells, mesenchymal stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells. There are not yet conclusive evidences on which types of glial or adult stem cells are most effective in {SCI} treatment. Their ability to incorporate into the damaged spinal cord, to differentiate into neural lineages, to exert neuroprotective effects, to promote regeneration of damaged axons, and to improve functional deficits are still discussed, before translation towards clinical use, as a single therapy or in combination with other strategies.},

{METHODS}: Five animals received a moderate contusion on T8, and over 28 days postoperation (dpo) locomotion and motor electrophysiological outcome were compared with five sham-operated animals.
{RESULTS}: At 28 dpo, the contused animals supported their body weight ({BBB} score =11.5 ± 0.5) and stepped uncoordinatedly. Motor evoked potentials recorded in the tibialis anterior ({TA}) and plantar muscles ({PL}), and longitudinal interlimb reflexes recorded in the {TA} muscles were abolished. The M wave recorded in the {TA} showed a decrease in amplitude by 7 dpo, which remained invariable until the end of the evaluation (88 ± 3\% of \{preoperative\} values), whereas in the {PL} muscle it was not affected. Injured animals presented hyperreflexia, as shown by an increased H/M ratio. Histological analysis showed similar number of retrogradely traced {TA} motoneurons between groups, and that contused animals presented hypertrophied astrocytes in the most rostral but not caudal segments of the lumbar enlargement.

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: Traumatic spinal cord injury ({SCI}) is a dreaded condition that can lead to paralysis and severe disability. With few treatment options available for patients who have suffered from {SCI}, it is important to develop prospective databases to standardize data collection in order to develop new therapeutic approaches and guidelines. Here, the authors present an overview of their multicenter, prospective, observational patient registry, Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in {SCI} ({TRACK}-{SCI}).
{METHODS}: Data were collected using the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke ({NINDS}) common data elements ({CDEs}). Highly granular clinical information, in addition to standardized imaging, biospecimen, and follow-up data, were included in the registry. Surgical approaches were determined by the surgeon treating each patient; however, they were carefully documented and compared within and across study sites. Follow-up visits were scheduled for 6 and 12 months after injury.
{RESULTS}: One hundred sixty patients were enrolled in the {TRACK}-{SCI} study. In this overview, basic clinical, imaging, neurological severity, and follow-up data on these patients are presented. Overall, 78.8\% of the patients were determined to be surgical candidates and underwent spinal decompression and/or stabilization. Follow-up rates to date at 6 and 12 months are 45\% and 36.3\%, respectively. Overall resources required for clinical research coordination are also discussed.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The authors established the feasibility of {SCI} {CDE} implementation in a multicenter, prospective observational study. Through the application of standardized {SCI} {CDEs} and expansion of future multicenter collaborations, they hope to advance {SCI} research and improve treatment.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Biomarkers of spinal cord injury ({SCI}) could help determine the severity of the injury and facilitate early critical care decision making. We analyzed global gene expression in peripheral white blood cells during the acute injury phase and identified 197 genes whose expression changed after {SCI} compared to healthy and trauma controls and in direct relation to {SCI} severity. Unsupervised co-expression network analysis identified several gene modules that predicted injury severity ({AIS} grades) with an overall accuracy of 72.7\% and included signatures of immune cell subtypes. Our findings indicate that global transcriptomic changes in peripheral blood cells have diagnostic and potentially prognostic value for {SCI} severity.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
