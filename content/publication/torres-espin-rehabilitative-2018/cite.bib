 abstract = {Rehabilitative motor training is currently one of the most widely used approaches to promote moderate recovery following injuries of the central nervous system. Such training is generally applied in the clinical setting, whereas it is not standard in preclinical research. This is a concern as it is becoming increasingly apparent that neuroplasticity enhancing treatments require training or some form of activity as a co-therapy to promote functional recovery. Despite the importance of training and the many open questions regarding its mechanistic consequences, its use in preclinical animal models is rather limited. Here we review approaches, findings and challenges when training is applied in animal models of spinal cord injury, and we suggest recommendations to facilitate the integration of training using an appropriate study design, into pre-clinical studies.},
