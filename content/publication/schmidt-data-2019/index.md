abstract: "STUDY PURPOSE: To establish a model of anxiety following a cervical contusion spinal cord injury (SCI) in rats and to determine whether the microbiota play a role in the observed behavioural changes. DATA COLLECTED: This dataset includes n=57 rats from 2 experiments. Experiment 1: sham (underwent surgery with no SCI) n=6; unilateral cervical contusion SCI n=6. Experiment 2: Healthy (no operation, no gavage) n=10; Sham n=11; SCI (gavaged with a control solution) n=10; SCI-FMT (gavaged with fecal microbiota transplant solution) n=14. A subset of subjects from experiment 2 were used for the fecal 16s rRNA analysis (healthy n = 10; SCI-FMT n = 10; sham n = 5; SCI n = 5). Fecal matter for the 16s rRNA analysis were collected before injury, 3 days after injury and 4 weeks after injury. A PICRUST analysis was performed to infer the functional pathways involved using the 16s rRNA gene data. Rats were assessed on a battery of behavioural tests: the light-dark box, the cylinder test, the sucrose preference test, the elevated plus maze and the open field. Lesion size was calculated as the percentage of damaged tissue area throughout the rostral-caudal extension of the injury site. PRIMARY CONCLUSION: Treatment with a fecal microbiota transplant in the acute post-injury period prevents spinal cord injury-induced gut dysbiosis as well as the development of anxiety-like behaviour."
