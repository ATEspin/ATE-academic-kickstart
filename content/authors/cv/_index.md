My current interest focuses on the intersection between neurotrauma research and data science. I strive to apply, explore and develop data science methods in traumatic injuries affecting the brain and the spinal cord to increase reproducibility, accelerate translation and augment evidence-based medical practice. These methods include machine learning and intelligence analytics, data sharing, data infrastructures, data mining and data visualization, among others.

I use the programming language R as primary tool, and Python from time to time.
