abstract: "Low neuronal cAMP levels in adults and a further decline following traumatic central nervous system (CNS) injury has been associated with the limited ability of neurons to regenerate. An approach to increase neuronal cAMP levels post injury is electrical stimulation. Stimulation as a tool to promote neuronal growth has largely been studied in the peripheral nervous system or in spared fibers of the CNS and this research suggests that a single session of electrical stimulation is sufficient to initiate a long-lasting axonal growth program. Here, we sought to promote plasticity and growth of the injured corticospinal tract with electrical cortical stimulation immediately after its spinal injury. Moreover, given the importance of rehabilitative motor training in the clinical setting and in translating plasticity into functional recovery, we applied training as a standard treatment to all rats (i.e., with or without electrical stimulation). Our findings show that electrical cortical stimulation did improve recovery in forelimb function compared to the recovery in unstimulated animals. This recovery is likely linked to increased corticospinal tract plasticity as evidenced by a significant increase in sprouting of collaterals above the lesion site, but not to increased regenerative growth through the lesion itself."
