An approach to increase neuronal cAMP levels post injury is electrical stimulation. Stimulation as a tool to promote neuronal growth has largely been studied in the peripheral nervous system or in spared fibers of the CNS and this research suggests that a single session of electrical stimulation is sufficient to initiate a long-lasting axonal growth program. Here, we sought to promote plasticity and growth of the injured corticospinal tract with electrical cortical stimulation immediately after its spinal injury. Moreover, given the importance of rehabilitative motor training in the clinical setting and in translating plasticity into functional recovery, we applied training as a standard treatment to all rats (i.e., with or without electrical stimulation). Our findings show that electrical cortical stimulation did improve recovery in forelimb function compared to the recovery in unstimulated animals. This recovery is likely linked to increased corticospinal tract plasticity as evidenced by a significant increase in sprouting of collaterals above the lesion site, but not to increased regenerative growth through the lesion itself.","tags":["Axonal collaterals","Electrical stimulation","Neurite growth","Plasticity","Spinal cord injury"],"title":"Single-session cortical electrical stimulation enhances the efficacy of rehabilitative motor training after spinal cord injury in rats","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\r\r\r\rThe nodes in the network represent researchers with whom I have published.

You can also find the code for this post on GitHub.\nLuckily for us, the hard work needed for this has been already programmed by amazing people out there, so we will be using these packages:\nlibrary(easyPubMed) #API connection with pubmed\rlibrary(tidyverse) #To facilitate some data wrangling\rlibrary(igraph) #To build the graph\rlibrary(visNetwork) #Interactive networks\rExtracting Pubmed information\rThe easyPubMed package can be used for‚Ä¶ yes, you guessed write‚Ä¶ easily extract information from Pubmed. So, the first thing to do is to search us and extract the list of authors in our papers from the ‚Äòmedline‚Äô format, tagged as ‚ÄòAU‚Äô.\nmy_entrez_id \u0026lt;- get_pubmed_ids(\u0026#39;Torres-Espin A\u0026#39;)\rmy_author_txt \u0026lt;- fetch_pubmed_data(my_entrez_id, format = \u0026quot;medline\u0026quot;)\rauthors\u0026lt;-my_author_txt[str_detect(my_author_txt, \u0026quot;^AU \u0026quot;)]\rcoauthors_list\u0026lt;-unique(str_remove_all(authors, \u0026#39;^AU - \u0026#39;))\rhead(coauthors_list)\r## [1] \u0026quot;Schmidt EKA\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Torres-Espin A\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Raposo PJF\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Madsen KL\u0026quot; ## [5] \u0026quot;Kigerl KA\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Popovich PG\u0026quot;\rNote that we use unique because we might have more than one paper with the same author. We do this because now we are going to search the list of co-authors to get the relationship of publication between them. If you only want to get the first level connections of each co-author with you, then do not need to collapse the coauthors_list.\nNow let‚Äôs create a data frame containing the list of co-authors for each author on our list of co-authors. We can do that by iterating through the same code we did before and saving the results in a list of data frames. We will stack the list of data frames at the end by calling rbind. If you know some R you probably know that this code can be collapsed in fewer lines and be more efficient using apply. I like using loops from time to time!\nauthor_list\u0026lt;-list()#define the list to save the data frames\rfor (i in 1:length(coauthors_list)){\rmy_entrez_id \u0026lt;- get_pubmed_ids(coauthors_list[i])\rmy_author_txt \u0026lt;- fetch_pubmed_data(my_entrez_id, format = \u0026quot;medline\u0026quot;)\rauthors\u0026lt;-my_author_txt[str_detect(my_author_txt, \u0026quot;^AU \u0026quot;)]\rauthors\u0026lt;-str_remove_all(authors, \u0026#39;^AU - \u0026#39;)\rauthor_list[[i]]\u0026lt;-data.frame(co_authors=authors, author=coauthors_list[i])\r}\rauthor_df\u0026lt;-do.call(rbind, author_list)#stack data frames\rThe next step is filtering our data frame to keep only the co-authors of our co-authors that are also our co-authors (this is getting tricky‚Ä¶). You could leave the co-authors of your co-authors that you have not publish with, but that can make the graph quite big and not useful for plotting. After filtering we create a new variable with the joint string between co-author and author, so that we can count how many times that joint happens.\nauthor_df\u0026lt;-author_df[author_df$co_authors%in%author_df$author,]%\u0026gt;%\rmutate(co_edge=paste(co_authors, author, sep = \u0026#39;_\u0026#39;))%\u0026gt;%\rgroup_by(co_edge)%\u0026gt;%\rsummarise(count=n())%\u0026gt;%\rseparate(co_edge, c(\u0026#39;co_authors\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;author\u0026#39;),sep = \u0026#39;_\u0026#39;)\rWe are ready to create the graph from the data frame. We specify the weight of the edges (using E) as the count of the times two authors published together. Note that in our count data ‚Äòauthor 1-author 2‚Äô counts different than ‚Äòauthor 2-author 1‚Äô for the same paper, so we are counting each article twice. That is not a problem since we are considering a undirected graph. We just need to remember that we will be representing each article 2 times. I did not care because graphically does not matter. Finally, we plot the graph (very rough!)\nauthor_g\u0026lt;-graph_from_data_frame(author_df,directed = F)\rE(author_g)$weight\u0026lt;-author_df$count\rauthor_g\u0026lt;-simplify(author_g)\rplot(author_g,edge.width = E(author_g)$weight)\rLast step is to make the graph pretty and play with the parameters. I find visNetwork package an amazing tool, so I recommend you explore it if you use networks.\nvis_g\u0026lt;-toVisNetworkData(author_g) #coverts the igraph object to

After discovering some of the work by Antonio S.Chinch√≥n and his blog Fronkonstin on using R and mathematics to create amazing art work, I decided to play around. Schotter (1968) is a famous piece by Georg Nees, a pioneer in computer graphics and probably one of the first creative coders.\nCHECK THE ORIGINAL NOW\nTo pay tribute to Georg, I decided to implement a chunk of code that would reproduce Schotter using R. There are probably several ways to code this algorithm and I am sure several people have done this before. My goal was to see if my current R knowledge could be use to program Schotter without checking other implementations and learn something on the way.\nHere my thought process.\nThe libraries\rNowadays I use ggplot2 for every visualization, so I decided to utilize its amazing graphical powers. I also used dplyr although we could easily not use it here.\nlibrary(ggplot2)\rlibrary(dplyr)\r\rBuilding a square\rThe easiest way to build a square in ggplot2 is probably using geom_rect, however I did not find a way to rotate the geometry, so I decided to go for a polygon (geom_polygon) and control the position of the 4 vertices outside ggplot. For that I created the following function:\nsquare\u0026lt;-function(x0=1,y0=1, size=1, angle=0){\rxor\u0026lt;-x0+size/2 #X origin (center of the square)\ryor\u0026lt;-y0+size/2 #Y origin (center of the square)\rtibble(\rx=c(x0,x0+size,x0+size,x0),\ry=c(y0,y0,y0+size,y0+size)\r)%\u0026gt;%mutate(x2=(x-xor)*cos(angle)-(y-yor)*sin(angle)+xor, #For rotation\ry2=(x-xor)*sin(angle)+(y-yor)*cos(angle)+yor) #for rotation\r}\rWhere x0 and y0 control the position of lower left (or other depending on the axis orientation) vertex, size the length of the sides and angle the amount of rotation from the original position. An x and y for each vertex is set as a template relative to x0, y0 and size. In this way, we will be able to control the position of the square in the canvas. x2 and y2 are set as the rotated coordinates for x and y, respectively. Ultimately, we will use x2 and y2, that will be equal to x and y if angle is 0. I decided to generate new columns for the rotations so I can plot both, the original x, y and the rotated (I confess I had to brush up my trigonometry and google a few things for this).\nggplot(square())+\rgeom_polygon(aes(x=x, y=y))+\rcoord_fixed()# just so that axis are equally spaced\rWe have our first square!! We can now play with fill and color\nggplot(square())+\rgeom_polygon(aes(x=x, y=y), fill=NA, color=\u0026#39;black\u0026#39;)+\rcoord_fixed()\rLet‚Äôs play with some parameters\nggplot(square(size=2,angle=pi/4))+#size 2 and rotate 45 degrees\rgeom_polygon(aes(x=x, y=y), fill=NA, color=\u0026#39;black\u0026#39;)+\rgeom_polygon(aes(x=x2, y=y2), fill=NA, color=\u0026#39;red\u0026#39;)+\rcoord_fixed()\r\rHow many squares we want?\rSchotter can be seen as a matrix of squares. A simple way to iterate through a matrix is to nest a loop inside a loop such that one loop goes through the rows and another through the columns.\nThe original Schotter has 12 columns and 24 rows (that I counted)\nn\u0026lt;-24*12\rdf.list\u0026lt;-list()\rfor (j in 1:24){ #iterate through the rows\rfor (i in 1:12){ #iterate through the columns\rtemp\u0026lt;-square(x=i, y=j) #create a square at column i and row j\rdf.list[[n]]\u0026lt;-temp #save the data frame with the square n on a list\rn\u0026lt;-n-1\r}\r}\rThis chunk creates a data frame containing the x, y, x2 and y2 for 288 (24x12) squares, that we can plotted. To plot each square independently as we will need for later, we need to add a new geom_polygon layer for each square to a ggplot object. We could have done this in the previous loops, but in the course of this mini project I have learned that you can pass a list to ggplot. So, we can iterate though our list of square data frames using lapply and add a geom_polygon for each square (a bit slow on my friend).\nggplot() + lapply(df.list, function(square_data) {\rgeom_polygon(data = square_data, aes(x = x2, y = y2), fill=NA, color=\u0026#39;black\u0026#39;)}\r)+\rcoord_fixed()\rNow we have the grid of squares.

An autonomous system in this context is generally one that is non-human and can independently determine features of an artwork that would otherwise require decisions made directly by the artist. \rAn easy way to give autonomy to our code is by introducing randomness. As we can appreciate from Schotter, both the position and the angle of the squares seems to be more random and move away from the ‚Äòcalm‚Äô stage as we move through the rows. We will add this to our nested loops by generating a random displacement and rotation for each square that increases by row.\nn\u0026lt;-24*12\rdf.list\u0026lt;-list()\rfor (j in 1:24){ #iterate through the rows\rfor (i in 1:12){ #iterate through the columns\rdisplace\u0026lt;-runif(1,-j,j) #a random number is generated from a uniform distribution with min=-j and max=j\rrotate\u0026lt;-runif(1,-j,j) #random number to rotate the square\rtemp\u0026lt;-square(x=i+displace, y=j+displace, angle=rotate) #create a square at column i and row j displaced by displace\rdf.list[[n]]\u0026lt;-temp #save the data frame with the square n on a list\rn\u0026lt;-n-1\r}\r}\rggplot() + lapply(df.list, function(square_data) {\rgeom_polygon(data = square_data, aes(x = x2, y = y2), fill=NA, color=\u0026#39;black\u0026#39;)}\r)+\rcoord_fixed()+\rtheme_background()\rUps! Something isn‚Äôt quite right (although I like it!). I think is because j, that controls how much displacement and rotation can be added get to be too big in respect to x and y. So, let‚Äôs control for that. For that I divided j by 40 in the case of displace and by 100 in the case of rotate. I found these numbers by playing around.

The objective of the current study is to establish a model of anxiety following a cervical contusion spinal cord injury in rats and to determine whether the microbiota play a role in the observed behavioural changes. We found that spinal cord injury caused dysbiosis and increased symptoms of anxiety-like behaviour. Treatment with a fecal transplant prevented both spinal cord injury-induced dysbiosis as well as the development of anxiety-like behaviour.

Currently, restoring lost motor function is the most actively studied and sought-after goal of spinal cord injury research. This research is rooted in the fact that although self-repair following spinal cord injury in adult mammals is very limited, there can be some recovery of motor function. This recovery is strongly dependent on the lesion size and location as well as on neural activity of denervated networks activated mainly through physical activity (i.e., rehabilitative training). Recovery of motor function is largely due to neuroplasticity, which includes adaptive changes in spared and injured neural circuitry. Neuroplasticity after spinal cord injury is extensive and includes mechanisms such as moderate axonal sprouting, the formation of new synaptic connections, network remapping, and changes to neuron cell properties. Neuroplasticity after spinal cord injury has been described at various physiological and anatomical levels of the central nervous system including the brain, brainstem, and spinal cord, both above and below injury sites. The growing number of mechanisms underlying postinjury plasticity indicate the vast complexity of injury-induced plasticity. This poses important opportunities to further enhance and harness plasticity in order to promote recovery. However, the diversity of neuroplasticity also creates challenges for research, which is frequently based on mechanistically driven approaches. The appreciation of the complexity of neuronal plasticity and the findings that recovery is based on a multitude and interlinked adaptations will be essential in developing meaningful new treatment avenues.","tags":null,"title":"Mechanisms of Behavioral Changes After Spinal Cord Injury","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Abel Torres-Esp√≠n","Juan Forero","Emma K.

Polytrauma and management of other medical complications in the acute post-injury setting often preclude or complicate early rehabilitation. Therefore, interventions that reopen a window of opportunity for effective motor training after chronic injury would have significant therapeutic value. Here, we tested whether this could be achieved in rats with chronic (8 weeks) dorsolateral quadrant sections of the cervical spinal cord (C4) by inducing mild neuroinflammation. We found that systemic injection of a low dose of lipopolysaccharide improved the efficacy of rehabilitative training on forelimb function, as assessed using a single pellet reaching and grasping task. This enhanced recovery was found to be dependent on the training intensity, where a high-intensity paradigm induced the biggest improvements. Importantly, in contrast to training alone, the combination of systemic lipopolysaccharide and high-intensity training restored original function (reparative plasticity) rather than enhancing new motor strategies (compensatory plasticity). Accordingly, electrophysiological and tract-tracing studies demonstrated a recovery in the cortical drive to the affected forelimb muscles and a restructuration of the corticospinal innervation of the cervical spinal cord. Thus, we propose that techniques that can elicit mild neuroinflammation may be used to enhance the efficacy of rehabilitative training after chronic spinal cord injury.","tags":["Animals","Cervical Cord","Female","Forelimb","Inflammation","Lipopolysaccharides","Myelitis","Nerve Regeneration","Neuronal Plasticity","Pyramidal Tracts","Rats","Rats","Inbred Lew","Recovery of Function","Spinal Cord","Spinal Cord Injuries"],"title":"Eliciting inflammation enables successful rehabilitative training in chronic spinal cord injury","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Abel Torres-Esp√≠n","Eric Beaudry","Keith Fenrich","Karim Fouad"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"54aa6e98eb6b7cf781722bc499ae1bb7","permalink":"/publication/torres-espin-rehabilitative-2018/","publishdate":"2020-01-22T07:44:03.4203Z","relpermalink":"/publication/torres-espin-rehabilitative-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Rehabilitative motor training is currently one of the most widely used approaches to promote moderate recovery following injuries of the central nervous system.

We completely transected all traced RtST axons in rats using a staggered model, where a hemisection SCI at vertebra T10 is followed by a contralateral hemisection at vertebra T7. In one group of the animals, the T7 SCI was performed 2 weeks after the T10 SCI (delayed; dSTAG), and in another group, the T10 and T7 SCIs were concomitant (cSTAG). dSTAG animals had significantly more RtST-PrIN contacts in the grey matter compared to cSTAG animals (p textless 0.05). These results were accompanied by enhanced locomotor recovery with dSTAG animals significantly outperforming cSTAG animals (BBB test; p textless 0.05). This difference suggests that activity in neuronal networks below the first SCI may contribute to enhanced recovery, because dSTAG rats recovered locomotor ability before the second hemisection.

In the hIL-37tg mice, the expression of IL-37 was barely detectable in the uninjured cords, but was strongly induced at 24 h and 72 h after the spinal cord injury (SCI). Compared with WT mice, hIL-37tg mice exhibited increased myelin and neuronal sparing and protection against locomotor deficits, including 2.5-fold greater speed in a forced treadmill challenge. Reduced levels of cytokines (e.g., an 80% reduction in IL-6) were observed in the injured cords of hIL-37tg mice, along with lower numbers of blood-borne neutrophils, macrophages, and activated microglia. We treated WT mice with a single intraspinal injection of either full-length or processed rIL-37 after the injury and found that the IL-37-treated mice had significantly enhanced locomotor skills in an open field using the Basso Mouse Scale, as well as supported faster speed on a mechanical treadmill. Treatment with both forms of rIL-37 led to similar beneficial effects on locomotor recovery after SCI.

The single pellet grasping (SPG) task is a skilled forelimb motor task used to evaluate recovery of forelimb function in rodent models of SCI. The task requires animals to obtain food pellets located on a shelf beyond a slit at the front of an enclosure. Manually training and testing rats in the SPG task requires extensive time and often yields results with high outcome variability and small therapeutic windows (i.e., the difference between pre- and post-SCI success rates). Recent advances in automated SPG training using automated pellet presentation (APP) systems allow rats to train ad libitum 24h a day, 7 days a week. APP trained rats have improved success rates, require less researcher time, and have lower outcome variability compared to manually trained rats. However, it is unclear whether APP trained rats can perform the SPG task using the APP system after SCI. Here we show that rats with cervical SCI can successfully perform the SPG task using the APP system. We found that SCI rats with APP training performed significantly more attempts, had slightly lower and less variable final score success rates, and larger therapeutic windows than SCI rats with manual training. These results demonstrate that APP training has clear advantages over manual training for evaluating reaching performance of SCI rats and represents a new tool for investigating rehabilitative motor training following CNS injury.","tags":["Animals","Automated animal training","Cervical Cord","Disease Models","Animal","Female","Food","Foot","Forelimb","Grasping","Motor behavior","Motor Skills","Neuronal Plasticity","Physical Conditioning","Animal","Rats","Rats","Inbred Lew","Reaching","Recovery of Function","Rehabilitation","Robotics","Single pellet grasping","Skilled motor task","Spinal Cord Injuries","Spinal cord injury"],"title":"Single pellet grasping following cervical spinal cord injury in adult rat using an automated full-time training robot","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Clara L√≥pez-Serrano","Abel Torres-Esp√≠n","Joaquim Hern√°ndez","Ana B.

We transplanted iPSC-derived NSCs, obtained from adult human somatic cells, into rats at 0 or 7 days after SCI, and evaluated motor-evoked potentials and locomotion of the animals. We histologically analyzed engraftment, proliferation, and differentiation of the iPSC-derived NSCs and the spared tissue in the spinal cords at 7, 21, and 63 days posttransplant. Both transplanted groups showed a late decline in functional recovery compared to vehicle-injected groups. Histological analysis showed proliferation of transplanted cells within the tissue and that cells formed a mass. At the final time point, most grafted cells differentiated to neural and astroglial lineages, but not into oligodendrocytes, while some grafted cells remained undifferentiated and proliferative. The proinflammatory tissue microenviroment of the injured spinal cord induced proliferation of the grafted cells and, therefore, there are possible risks associated with iPSC-derived NSC transplantation. New approaches are needed to promote and guide cell differentiation, as well as reduce their tumorigenicity once the cells are transplanted at the lesion site.","tags":["Animals","Cell Differentiation","Cell Lineage","Cell therapy","Cells","Cultured","Cellular Microenvironment","Differentiation","Evoked Potentials","Female","Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein","Humans","Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells","Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)","Locomotion","Nestin","Neural Stem Cells","Neural stem cells (NSCs)","Neurogenesis","Rats","Rats","Sprague-Dawley","Recovery of Function","Spinal Cord","Spinal Cord Injuries","Spinal cord injury (SCI)","Transplantation","Heterologous"],"title":"Effects of the Post-Spinal Cord Injury Microenvironment on the Differentiation Capacity of Human Neural Stem Cells Derived from Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diego Reginensi","Patricia Carulla","Sara Nocentini","Oscar Seira","Xavier Serra-Picamal","Abel Torres-Esp√≠n","Andreu Matamoros-Angles","Rosalina Gav√≠n","Mar√≠a Teresa Moreno-Flores","Francisco Wandosell","Josep Samitier","Xavier Trepat","Xavier Navarro","Jos√© Antonio del R√≠o"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1435708800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1435708800,"objectID":"c39fcbde1eec59b3936e33e08cf3b19d","permalink":"/publication/reginensi-increased-2015/","publishdate":"2020-01-22T07:44:03.473447Z","relpermalink":"/publication/reginensi-increased-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"Olfactory ensheathing cell (OEC) transplantation emerged some years ago as a promising therapeutic strategy to repair injured spinal cord. However, inhibitory molecules are present for long periods of time in lesioned spinal cord, inhibiting both OEC migration and axonal regrowth. Two families of these molecules, chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans (CSPG) and myelin-derived inhibitors (MAIs), are able to trigger inhibitory responses in lesioned axons. Mounting evidence suggests that OEC migration is inhibited by myelin. Here we demonstrate that OEC migration is largely inhibited by CSPGs and that inhibition can be overcome by the bacterial enzyme Chondroitinase ABC. In parallel, we have generated a stable OEC cell line overexpressing the Nogo receptor (NgR) ectodomain to reduce MAI-associated inhibition in vitro and in vivo. Results indicate that engineered cells migrate longer distances than unmodified OECs over myelin or oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein (OMgp)-coated substrates. In addition, they also show improved migration in lesioned spinal cord. Our results provide new insights toward the improvement of the mechanisms of action and optimization of OEC-based cell therapy for spinal cord lesion.","tags":["Animals","Axons","Cell Movement","Cells","Cultured","Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycans","Cloning","Molecular","GPI-Linked Proteins","Microfluidic Analytical Techniques","Myelin Proteins","Myelin Sheath","Nerve Regeneration","Neuroglia","Nogo Receptor 1","Olfactory Bulb","Oligodendrocyte-Myelin Glycoprotein","Protein Structure","Tertiary","Rats","Receptors","Cell Surface","Spinal Cord Injuries","Time-Lapse Imaging"],"title":"Increased migration of olfactory ensheathing cells secreting the Nogo receptor ectodomain over inhibitory substrates and lesioned spinal cord","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Abel Torres-Esp√≠n","Elena Redondo-Castro","Joaquim Hernandez","Xavier Navarro"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1425168000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1425168000,"objectID":"3eeaeb508e983d3c106d880ab29af498","permalink":"/publication/torres-espin-immunosuppression-2015/","publishdate":"2020-01-22T07:44:03.48342Z","relpermalink":"/publication/torres-espin-immunosuppression-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"Cell therapy for spinal cord injury (SCI) is a promising strategy for clinical application.

Even when regeneration is successful, unspecific reinnervation and the limited reconnection of the spinal circuits impair functional recovery. The aim of this study was to describe the changes that axotomized motoneurons suffer after peripheral nerve injury and how activity-dependent therapies and neurotrophic factors can modulate these events. We observed a marked decrease in glutamatergic synapses, with a maximum peak at two weeks post-axotomy, which was only partially reversed with time. This decrease was accompanied by an increase in gephyrin immunoreactivity and a disintegration of perineuronal nets (PNNs) surrounding the motoneurons. Direct application of neurotrophins at the proximal stump was not able to reverse these effects. In contrast, activity-dependent treatment, in the form of treadmill running, reduced the observed destructuring of perineuronal nets and the loss of glutamatergic synapses two weeks after injury. These changes were proportional to the intensity of the exercise protocol. Blockade of sensory inputs from the homolateral hindlimb also reduced PNN immunoreactivity around intact motoneurons, and in that case treadmill running did not reverse that loss, suggesting that the effects of exercise on motoneuron PNN depend on increased sensory activity. Preservation of motoneuron PNN and reduction of synaptic stripping by exercise could facilitate the maintenance of the spinal circuitry and benefit functional recovery after peripheral nerve injury.","tags":["Animals","Axotomy","Disease Models","Animal","Female","Immunohistochemistry","Motoneurons","Motor Neurons","Nerve injury","Nerve Regeneration","Perineuronal nets","Peripheral Nerve Injuries","Physical Conditioning","Animal","Plasticity","Rats","Rats","Sprague-Dawley","Recovery of Function","Spinal Cord","Treadmill running"],"title":"Activity dependent therapies modulate the spinal changes that motoneurons suffer after a peripheral nerve injury","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Elena Redondo-Castro","Rafael Romero","Abel Torres-Esp√≠n","Juana Utrera","Daniel Duque","F√®lix Junyent","Carme Auladell"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1412121600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1412121600,"objectID":"04d49c776d924995972c9caa57dd6677","permalink":"/publication/redondo-castro-dithiocarb-2014/","publishdate":"2020-01-22T07:44:03.500375Z","relpermalink":"/publication/redondo-castro-dithiocarb-2014/","section":"publication","summary":"AIMS: Dithiocarb (diethyldithiocarbamate, DEDTC) belongs to the group of dithiocarbamates and is the main metabolite of disulphiram, a drug of choice for the treatment of alcohol dependence. Its therapeutic potential relays on its ability to create an unpleasant aversive reaction following the ingestion of alcohol, and this effect is usually accompanied by neurobehavioural symptoms. Most of these can be attributed to the impaired metabolism of brain biogenic amines. METHODS: To gain new insights into the dithiocarbamates and their effects on neurotransmitter systems, an in vivo experimental model based on daily injections of DEDTC in adult mice for 7 days was established. To this end, the concentrations of the three major brain monoamines, dopamine (DA), noradrenaline (NA) and serotonin (5-HT) were measured in whole brain extracts with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The levels of D2 dopamine receptor (D2R) were evaluated by Western blot and by immunohistochemical techniques the cell pattern of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopa beta hydroxylase (DBH) and choline acetyltransferase ChAT) were analysed. RESULTS: A significant reduction in DA and 5-HT levels was observed, whereas NA was not affected. Moreover, decreases in D2R levels, as well as in enzymes such as TH, DBH and ChAT, were found. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that DEDTC provokes alterations in biogenic amines and in different substrates of neurotransmitter systems, which could explain some of the neurobehavioural effects observed in patients treated with disulphiram.","tags":["alcoholism","Animals","biogenic amines","Biogenic Monoamines","brain","Brain","Brain Chemistry","Choline O-Acetyltransferase","DEDTC","Ditiocarb","Dopamine","Male","Mice","Norepinephrine","psychiatric alterations","Receptors","Dopamine D2","Serotonin","toxicity","Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase"],"title":"Dithiocarb (N,N-diethyldithiocarbamate, DEDTC) decreases levels of biogenic monoamines in the adult mouse brain","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Abel Torres-Esp√≠n","Elena Redondo-Castro","Joaquim Hern√°ndez","Xavier Navarro"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1398902400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1398902400,"objectID":"6c3ae60daf3f9819baef142df3b70e1c","permalink":"/publication/torres-espin-bone-2014/","publishdate":"2020-01-22T07:44:03.489404Z","relpermalink":"/publication/torres-espin-bone-2014/","section":"publication","summary":"Cell therapy for spinal cord injury (SCI) is a promising strategy for clinical application.

The chances for functional recovery after ventral root avulsion are very poor owing to the loss of avulsed neurons and the long distance that surviving neurons have to re-grow axons from the spinal cord to the corresponding targets. Following unilateral avulsion of L4, L5 and L6 spinal roots in adult rats, we performed an intraspinal transplant of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and surgical re-implantation of the avulsed roots. Four weeks after avulsion the survival of MN in the MSC-treated animals was significantly higher than in vehicle-injected rats (45% vs. 28%). Re-implantation of the avulsed roots in the injured spinal cord allowed the regeneration of motor axons. By combining root re-implantation and MSC transplant the number of surviving MN at 28 days post-injury was higher (60%) than in re-implantation alone animals (46%). Electromyographic tests showed evidence of functional re-innervation of anterior tibialis and gastrocnemius muscles by the regenerated motor axons only in rats with the combined treatment. These results indicate that MSC are helpful in enhancing neuronal survival and increased the regenerative growth of injured axons. Surgical re-implantation and MSC grafting combined had a synergic neuroprotective effect on MN and on axonal regeneration and muscle re-innervation after spinal root avulsion.","tags":["Animals","Axons","Behavior","Animal","Cell Count","Cell Survival","Cells","Cultured","Female","Fibroblasts","Image Processing","Computer-Assisted","Immunohistochemistry","Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation","Motor Activity","Motor Neurons","Nerve Regeneration","Nervous System Diseases","Neurites","Organ Culture Techniques","Rats","Rats","Sprague-Dawley","Spinal Nerve Roots"],"title":"Neuroprotection and axonal regeneration after lumbar ventral root avulsion by re-implantation and mesenchymal stem cells transplant combined therapy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Elena Redondo-Castro","Abel Torres-Esp√≠n","Guillermo Garc√≠a-Al√≠as","Xavier Navarro"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1362096000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1362096000,"objectID":"45a0c3a1769ee1b3cf94034ec5689dd3","permalink":"/publication/redondo-castro-quantitative-2013/","publishdate":"2020-01-22T07:44:03.511344Z","relpermalink":"/publication/redondo-castro-quantitative-2013/","section":"publication","summary":"Animal models of spinal cord injury (SCI) are intended to mimic the main features of human spinal cord lesions, although sometimes it becomes a difficult task to find the right technique to discriminate the severity of the lesion as well as to assess different aspects of functional recovery.

Moreover, an extensive study based on the quantification of alternation and coordination parameters during gait has been done. Spinal cord injuries of varying severity (mild contusion, moderate contusion and hemisection) were performed at the thoracic level in adult rats that were followed-up for 6 weeks. Lesions resulting in similar scores in the open field test (i.e. mild contusion and hemisection) caused more marked differences in fine coordination when assessed by quantitative coordination analysis based on a digitized walking treadmill. In conclusion, gross and fine deficits can be detected using a battery of tests based on the performance of the animals during tasks of different difficulty.

In contrast, cells transplanted at 7 days after injury down-regulate genes related to tissue regeneration. The most important change after MSC or OEC transplant was a marked increase in expression of genes associated with foreign body response and adaptive immune response. These data suggest a regulatory effect of MSC and OEC transplantation after SCI regarding tissue repair processes, but a fast rejection response to the grafted cells.
