I was born in [Mataro](https://www.google.es/search?q=mataro&rlz=1C1CHZL_enCA733CA734&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj_v_j7nN3dAhVDiRoKHf_DCR0Q_AUICigB&biw=1536&bih=718), close to Barcelona, Spain. I studied biology at the [Universitat de Barcelona](https://www.ub.edu/web/ub/en/index.html?) from 2002 to 2007. In 2008 I started my PhD in the neuroscience program at the [Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona](https://www.uab.cat/es/) under the supervision of [Dr. Xavier Navarro](http://inc.uab.cat/English/profile.php?id=105), finishing my thesis entitled 'Terapia celular para lesiones que afectan a la medula espinal' (Cell therapy for injuries affecting the spinal cord). In 2014, I moved to Edmonton, Canada, for a postdoctoral position at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html) under the supervision of [Dr. Karim Fouad](https://www.ualberta.ca/rehabilitation/about-us/contact-us/faculty-directory/karim-fouad). Here, I worked on the interaction between neuroinflammation and rehabilitative motor training after cervical spinal cord injury. Since November 2018, I am working at the [University of California San Francisco](https://www.ucsf.edu/) in a team led by [Dr. Adam Ferguson](http://neurosurgery.ucsf.edu/index.php/about_us_faculty_ferguson.html), where we work on the application of data science to accelerate neurotrauma research and translation.

When I'm not doing research, I spend my time coding, visiting mountains and climbing.
